"""
A self-contained, credential-free demo scenario.

Purpose: run the entire Phase 1 pipeline end to end with deterministic fakes, so
the wiring, the invariants and the completeness assertions can be exercised in
CI and demonstrated locally. The clinical content is realistic but synthetic —
it is a harness, not a data source.

The scenario deliberately includes the failure modes that mattered:
  * a comparator whose class must come from ITS OWN INN, not the intervention's
  * a record about a DIFFERENT subject drug, which must be rejected
  * an induction-phase backbone whose role is prior_therapy, not comparator
  * a guideline landscape document naming a comparator the drug-anchored query
    would never surface
  * outcome categories where nothing is found, which must still be reported

Second-line treatment of relapsed extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.

For patients relapsing after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, topotecan

vincristine) is an alternative option [II, B] and may be preferred where
myelosuppression is a concern. For patients with a chemotherapy-free interval of
at least 90 days, re-challenge with a platinum doublet is a valid option [II, B].

Recommended outcomes for assessment in this setting are overall survival,
progression-free survival, objective response rate, and health-related quality of

should also be captured.
